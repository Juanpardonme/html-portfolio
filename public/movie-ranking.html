<h1>The Best Movies According to Juan Pablo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>This is one of the last movies that I watched, and it really blew my mind.<br />
It is a Korean movie and it is about a family that finds the way to move to this other very rich family's house,
pretending to be people they're not. I'm not very good explaining... </p>
<h3>Bohemian Rhapsody</h3>
<p>As a music lover this movie deffinetly has to be in my top 3, I don't think I have to tell too much about
this movie.</p>
<h3>Superbad</h3>
<p>I needed to add a funny movie on this top 3, and this one really bring a lot of memories of the 
friends I went with to watch it at the cinema.</p>
